Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
When the moon begins to hide
It's not over
In the window, turning light
Does not mean goodbye
And too
When candles burn out and the
Record has faded down I know
You've got people to turn to
And too
When candles burn out and the
Record has faded down I know
You've got people to turn to
What is it?
That's keeping one foot out
And the other crawling in bed
And what is it?
That's keeping you alone
And leaving after we slow dance
And we fall back in routine
It can't be over
And I remember everything
You used to know her
I could
Trace it all the way back,
I could
Trace it all the way back
And too
When candles burn out and the
Record has faded down I know
You've got people to turn to
And too
When candles burn out and the
Record has faded down I know
You've got people to turn to
What is it?
That's keeping one foot out
And the other crawling in bed
And what is it?
That's keeping you alone
And leaving after we slow dance
And too
When candles burn out and the
Record has faded down I know
You've got people to turn to
And too
When candles burn out and the
Record has faded down I know
You've got people to turn to
